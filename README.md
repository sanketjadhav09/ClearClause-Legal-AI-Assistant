# ⚖️ ClearClause — A Legal AI Assistant
### 🤖 *A Legal AI Chatbot powered by Gemini API*

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**ClearClause** is a Streamlit-based **Legal AI Assistant** designed to help users interact with their legal documents in a more intuitive way.  

It allows users to:

- 📑 **Upload and analyze legal documents** (`PDF` / `DOCX`)  
- 🤖 **Ask questions** about the uploaded documents or general legal queries  
- 📝 **Generate detailed summaries** with **custom instructions**  
- 🌍 **Translate text** into multiple languages (currently **Hindi** and **Marathi**)  

The system uses **Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash model** for **QnA, summarization, and translation**, and **FAISS vector database** for efficient semantic search across uploaded documents.

## 🔄 Workflow Explanation

The application's core is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that can be broken down into three main stages:

![Architecture Diagram](Outputs/Architecture_Diagram.png)

1.  📄 **Indexing:** When a `.pdf` or `.docx` is uploaded, its text is extracted, split into intelligent chunks, and converted into a searchable **FAISS vector index**.

2.  🔎 **Retrieval:** For document-specific queries, the system performs a semantic search on the index to find the most relevant text chunks related to the user's prompt.

3.  🤖 **Generation:** The retrieved context (or the direct prompt for general queries) is sent to the **Google Gemini Model**, which generates the final output—whether it's a direct answer, a custom summary, or a translation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Git** version control system
- A **Google Gemini API Key**
  - You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sanketjadhav09/ClearClause-Legal-AI-Assistant.git
    cd ClearClause-Legal-AI-Assistant
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    - This keeps the project dependencies isolated.

    - **On Windows:**
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - **On macOS/Linux:**
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

3.  **Install Required Libraries**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up the Environment Variable**
    - Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project folder.
    - Add your Google Gemini API key to this file as follows:
      ```
      API_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY_HERE"
      ```

---

## 💻 Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the application locally with a single command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser to interact with the ClearClause Legal AI Assistant.

---

## 🌐 Deployment

This application is designed for and deployed on **Streamlit Community Cloud**. The deployment process is automated via GitHub:

1.  A public GitHub repository holds the application code (`app.py`, `requirements.txt`, etc.).
2.  The `.env` file containing the `API_KEY` is kept local and ignored by Git via `.gitignore`.
3.  The API key is securely stored in the Streamlit Cloud application's **Secrets management**.
4.  Any push to the `main` branch on GitHub automatically triggers a redeployment of the application.
